For editing and switch branchs:

		- after saving it stay in ../Project in the git bash terminal and do this
			- git add introduction/index.html
			- git commit -m "<Any text can go here, but prob best to a short one liner description of what you did>"
			- git checkout master<-- once back in master go to ../Project/website in master to use "yarn start"
		   - alt: you could be in ../Project/introduction:
			- git add .
			- git commit -m "<same as above>"<-- might need to be in ../Project
			- move using "cd .."  back to ../Project and use "git checkout master" and travers back to ../Project/website
			- yarn start
